# Spreadsheet Application - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this project, I built a spreadsheet application using functional programming principles. The main goal is to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions, implement spreadsheet functions, handle cell references, and create an interactive interface that dynamically updates based on user input.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Interactive Web Application
- **Purpose**: Implement a basic spreadsheet to evaluate expressions and manage cell references, following functional programming principles.
- **Skills Learned**: Functional programming, parsing expressions, cell reference management, dynamic page updates

## Features
- ðŸ§® **Mathematical Expression Evaluation**: Users can input and calculate expressions in cells.
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Updates**: The page automatically updates when users input new data or modify cell values.
- ðŸ”— **Cell References**: Users can reference other cells in their expressions, allowing for complex calculations.
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Interface**: Clickable cells with real-time feedback and dynamic data changes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup structure for the spreadsheet grid
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, responsive, and interactive layout
- **JavaScript**: Functional programming techniques for handling expressions, cell references, and dynamic updates

## Installation
To try the spreadsheet application:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
